# WeatherReminder
Simple python script that utilizes the  Twilio API and WeatherBit API to send out a text message at a user pre-defined time of the current weather data at any location they set in the world. 

I started this project because every morning  I would wake up and not know the weather for the day, and although I have weather apps on my phone,  I never took the time to actually check them consistently. This way  I could use the Twilio API to send a text message of the  data I received from the WeatherBit API that would directly tell me the weather for the day without me having to check. 

# Before you Start
In order to use this file for yourself, you must make a Twilio account to get and Account ID and  Authentication  Token as mine will not work for you. That and if using trial account, you can only send to your phone number registered. In addition to this you will need built in python libraries including json, requests, dateTime, and threading.
